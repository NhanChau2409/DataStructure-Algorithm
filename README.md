## Acknowledgement

- How to choose the suitable Data Structure for the best
performance. 
    - e.g Which contatiner is apporiate for some purposes.

- How to implement basic Algorithm.
    - e.g Sorting (Quick sort, Merge Sort), Tree (Heap Algorithm, Binary Tree Algorithm), Graph (Weight Graph) 

- How to micro optimize performance
    - e.g Using pointer, storing ouput of function for later use instead of repeating. 


## Installation

Make sure you have Clang in your computer to run C++.

## Testing
